firestick tank - blocklist uncommented
There were a couple blocklists for Amazon but the majority of them still allowed basic connections, this one currently blocks everything 
and you can only run apps you've already installed. I found performance has improved and will maintain this until I get around to 
flashing the firestick with a new OS.
