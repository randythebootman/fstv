firestick tank - blocklist uncommented
There were a couple blocklists for Amazon but the majority of them still allowed basic connections, this one currently blocks everything 
and you can only run apps you've already installed by going into setting and apps or just holding the home key for 3s and selecting apps. I found video performance has improved and will maintain this until I get around to flashing the firestick with a new OS.
